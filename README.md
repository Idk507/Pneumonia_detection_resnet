This project aims to address the pressing need for accurate and timely diagnosis of pneumonia through the development of a robust machine learning-based detection system. The researchers leverage the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Class Activation Maps (CAM) to enhance the diagnostic accuracy and interpretability of their model. Utilising the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset from Kaggle, the team meticulously trains and fine-tunes a modified ResNet18 architecture using the PyTorch Lightning framework. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, where the classifier exhibits commendable performance in distinguishing between healthy and pneumonia-affected individuals. Crucially, the integration of CAM provides valuable insights into the decision-making process of the classifier, thereby improving transparency and trust in the diagnostic system. This project represents a significant stride towards revolutionising pneumonia diagnosis, offering both accurate detection and interpretable results, with the ultimate goal of contributing to improved healthcare outcomes in respiratory medicine
